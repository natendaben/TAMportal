					<h2 class="projhead">Virtual Nature Box</h2>
					<p class="install projdesc">Maker Made 2019 Gallery, BLDG 61.</p>
					<p class="projdesc">Wood, Acrylic, Paint, Microcontroller & Electronic Components, 2018.</p>
					<p class="projdesc">8.5" x 9" x 6".</p>
					<p class="projdesc">Now, all you need to experience the sounds and sights of nature is the brand new Virtual Nature Box. Outfitted with an adjustable time-of-day lighting system, authentic audio effects, and a powerful wind generator, this portable nature package also features a beautiful hand-painted scenery insert and durable wood construction.</p>
					<p class="projdesc">The inspiration for this project arose from a discussion about virtual reality in one of my classes, and the book <span class="italic"> The Nature Fix</span> by Florence Williams. Despite many the technological advances in the past few years, our attempts at creating representations of nature (from photos and film to 3D virtual reality experiences) fail at creating the same kind of awe, joy, contentment, and chemical changes in the brain that authentic experiences of being outside can create.</p>
					<p class="projdesc">Therefore, I designed the Virtual Nature Box to be a satire on this idea of virtual nature experiences, playing on the fact that despite the newest technology and effects, virtual nature canâ€™t really compare to the real thing: being outside.</p>

					<p class="last projdesc">For this film, I shot all of the footage, composed the score using Ableton Live, conducted the interviews, and synthesized research from peer-reviewed articles with all of these components to create a finished product.</p>

					<h2 class="projhead">E.T.V.</h2>
					<p class="install projdesc">ATLAS Institute, University of Colorado Boulder.</p>
					<p class="projdesc">Mixed media, 2018.</p>
					<p class="projdesc">An eclectic installation that draws inspiration from the retro aesthetic and features a powerful ability to track nearby satellites. E.T.V. dares its audience to dive into a story defined by shifting realities and the nebulous nature of truth.</p>
					<p class="last projdesc">This installation includes a sculpture of a finger that points in real time to low-earth orbit satellites traveling overhead. A Raspberry Pi computer constantly pulls satellite location data from the SatNOGS network and transmits it to an Arduino that controls and moves the sculpture. For this project, I was in charge of implementing the Arduino components, including managing the serial communication between the Arduino and a Python program and translating this data into azimuth and elevation coordinates for the servo motors.</p>
