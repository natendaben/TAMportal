					<h2 class="workhead">Physical Computing</h2>
					<p class="workdesc">This class was my first introduction to physical computing, but I quickly fell in love with combining materials, electronics, and sensors to create interactive systems. Throughout the semester, I completed multiple labs and two major projects. You can also check out my journal, where I planned and documented each major project, by clicking <a class="worklink" href="https://natebennett1.wordpress.com/category/object" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
